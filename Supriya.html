<h1>Devops Tools</h1>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.

A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. Itâ€™s a new way of working, a cultural shift, that has significant implications for teams and the organizations they work for.
